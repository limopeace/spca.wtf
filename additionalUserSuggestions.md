# Additional Recommendations for Your Website

Based on the documents you've shared and the context of your website, here are some additional recommendations to strengthen your legal position and improve the website's effectiveness:

## 1. Implement a Cookie Policy

In addition to your disclaimer, consider adding a specific cookie policy to inform visitors about what cookies are used on your site and how data is collected. This is especially important for compliance with global data protection regulations.

## 2. Add a Copyright Notice

Place a visible copyright notice in the footer of your website to protect your content:
```
Â© 2025 [Your Name/Website Name]. All rights reserved.
```

## 3. Create a "Report Inaccuracies" Feature

Add a simple form allowing visitors to report any factual inaccuracies they find on the website. This demonstrates your commitment to accuracy and provides a mechanism for correction.

## 4. Include Source Citations

For all factual claims, especially those that could be considered controversial, include clear source citations. This might include:
- Dates of official communications
- File/reference numbers for RTI applications
- Names of officials (where legally appropriate to share)
- Dates of site visits or observations

## 5. Separate Facts from Opinions

Clearly distinguish between factual reporting and personal opinions/commentary. You might use different formatting, sections, or visual cues to make this distinction clear to readers.

## 6. Add a Photo Usage Disclaimer

If you're using photographs, especially of the SPCA facility or animals, add a specific disclaimer about these images, such as:
```
All photographs on this website were taken in public spaces or with appropriate permission. 
Photos are shared for documentary and educational purposes only.
```

## 7. Implement Regular Content Reviews

Set up a schedule to review all content regularly (e.g., quarterly) to ensure it remains accurate and up-to-date. Document these reviews to demonstrate your ongoing commitment to accuracy.

## 8. Create an "About" Section

Add a transparent "About" section explaining who you are, your qualifications to speak on these issues, and your motivation for creating the website. This builds credibility and contextualizes your work.

## 9. Consider a Press/Media Policy

If you anticipate media interest in your website, create guidelines for how your content may be used by news organizations or other third parties.

## 10. Document Retention Policy

Create a clear policy for how long you retain any user data and how you respond to requests for data deletion. This is important for privacy compliance.

## 11. Add HTTPS Security

Ensure your website uses HTTPS protocol to protect user data and improve trustworthiness.

## 12. Create a Mobile-Responsive Design

Ensure your website functions well on mobile devices, as many users may access it via smartphones.

## Technical Implementation Notes

For the disclaimer modal:
- Consider setting an expiration date for the localStorage value, so users are periodically reminded of the terms
- Add keyboard accessibility for users who navigate via keyboard
- Ensure the modal is screen reader-friendly for users with visual impairments
